# podcastify

L3's Software development project #1

You will use generative AI to help you learn concepts and implement a web-based application that converts text transcripts or audio uploads into enhanced, playable podcasts from one or two people using ReactJS, ExpressJS, Google's Gemini API, and Web Speech API. (if you find another AI API more suitable, you can use it instead of Gemini). This prototype will showcase your ability to work with cutting-edge AI and audio processing technologies.
